# ESP-01-CH330N-USB-Programmer

This is a very simple but effective USB programmer for the ESP8266-01 Wifi microcontroller.
It uses a new CH330N SOIC-8 chip which is very easy to implement in ESP projects at a very low cost with few additional components.
The repository includes datasheet, drivers, schematics, Eagle board files and gerbers as well as an Eagle library file for the CH330N.
The drivers used for the CH330N are the same as the CH341.
